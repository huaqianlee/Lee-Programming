# A code collection for my programmming exercises

For a long time, I have been doing BSP related work. Although I am very interested in programming, I have been learning too much without a solid foundation, and have poor programming skills. This makes me sad, so I am ready to learn again, and to do enough proactive programming.

# C

First, start with the C language I am most familiar with.
